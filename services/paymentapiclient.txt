/**
 * PaymentApiClient
 * ----------------
 * This is a tiny PHP class that your web app uses to talk to your Payment API.
 *
 * WHY do we need this?
 * - We don’t want to expose the API key in the browser or JavaScript.
 * - We want a single place to send requests (withdraw, resolveStudent, etc.).
 * - We can easily swap API URL or key later by editing one config file.
 *
 * HOW does it work?
 * - It loads API base URL + API key from config/payment.php.
 * - It offers public methods (withdraw, resolveStudent) that call your Payment API endpoints.
 * - Under the hood it uses cURL to send JSON and get back JSON.
 *
 * You include this file and create a new PaymentApiClient() wherever you need to
 * charge a student or look up their card/balance.
